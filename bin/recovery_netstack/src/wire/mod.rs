//! Serialization and deserialization of wire formats.
//!
//! This module provides efficient serialization and deserialization of the
//! various wire formats used by this program. Where possible, it uses lifetimes
//! and immutability to allow for safe zero-copy parsing.
//!
//! # Endianness
//!
//! All values exposed or consumed by this crate are in host byte order, so the
//! caller does not need to worry about it. Any necessary conversions are
//! performed under the hood.
